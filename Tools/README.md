# QLM Tools

This directory contains **tools and companion systems** associated with the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

Tools in this directory are designed to explore, verify, and apply QLM derivations and constraints. They do not define the QLM framework and do not introduce independent physical assumptions.

## Titus — QLM Companion System

**Titus** is an interactive assistant built to explore, explain, and verify the Quantum Lattice Model using its canonical foundations and extensions.

Titus operates strictly from the published QLM documents contained in this repository and serves as a computational and conceptual aid for:
- checking dimensional consistency,
- tracing derivations,
- mapping QLM expressions to standard physics,
- and exploring consequences of the lattice rules.

Titus does **not** modify QLM assumptions, notation, or results.  
The QLM papers remain the sole source of physical authority.
