  <h1>QLM Tools</h1>

  <p>
    This directory contains <strong>tools and companion systems</strong> associated with
    the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).
  </p>

  <p>
    Tools in this directory are designed to explore, verify, and apply QLM derivations
    and constraints. They do not define the QLM framework and do not introduce independent
    physical assumptions.
  </p>

  <h2>Titus — QLM Companion System</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Titus</strong> is an interactive assistant built to explore, explain, and
    verify the Quantum Lattice Model using its canonical foundations and extensions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Titus operates strictly from the published QLM documents contained in this repository
    and serves as a computational and conceptual aid for:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>checking dimensional consistency,</li>
    <li>tracing derivations,</li>
    <li>mapping QLM expressions to standard physics,</li>
    <li>and exploring consequences of the lattice rules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Titus does <strong>not</strong> modify QLM assumptions, notation, or results.
    The QLM papers remain the sole source of physical authority.
  </p>
