# QLM Extensions

This directory contains **extensions and derived results** of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

All works in this directory are derived strictly from the canonical QLM foundations and do not introduce new primitive assumptions, degrees of freedom, or free parameters.

## Included Extensions

### Planck Energy Density Cap and Saturated Core Completion

This extension derives a universal Planck energy density cap and a non-singular saturated-core interior for gravitational collapse while preserving exact Schwarzschild exterior behavior.
