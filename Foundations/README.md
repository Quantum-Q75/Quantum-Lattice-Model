# QLM Foundations

This directory contains the **canonical foundations** of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

The foundational paper establishes the reduced-action, per-radian Planck-unit framework from which all QLM results are derived. It defines the primitive lattice rules, Planck-unit collapses, and the deterministic phase–action structure underlying the model.
