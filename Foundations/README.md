# QLM Foundations

This directory contains the **canonical foundations** of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

The foundational paper establishes the reduced-action, per-radian Planck-unit framework from which all QLM results are derived. It defines the primitive lattice rules, Planck-unit collapses, and the deterministic phase–action structure underlying the model.

## Canonical Reference

**Quantum Lattice Model: Reduced-Action Foundations & Planck-Unit Derivations**  
December 4, 2025

This paper serves as the canonical foundations reference for the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM). The original version was released on December 4, 2025. A notation-aligned archival update was uploaded on December 26, 2025, followed by an impedance-consistent revision (v1.1) aligning the Planck impedance normalization to Z_P = Z_0 / (4pi). This update propagates the corrected per-radian impedance definition Z_P = Z_0 / (4pi) (with loop-aggregated form Z_P(loop) = Z_0 / 2) throughout all dependent electromagnetic derivations and synchronizes the manuscript with the Zenodo archival record.

No equations, assumptions, derivational structure, numerical results, or conceptual foundations of the reduced-action framework were altered. The revisions clarify normalization and ensure full internal consistency across the electromagnetic sector while preserving the original theoretical structure.
