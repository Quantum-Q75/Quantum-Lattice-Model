  <h1>QLM Foundations</h1>

  <p>
    This directory contains the canonical foundations of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundational paper establishes the reduced-action, per-radian Planck-unit framework
    from which all QLM results are derived. It defines the primitive lattice rules,
    Planck-unit collapses, and the deterministic phase–action structure underlying the model.
