# Quantum Lattice Model (QLM)

The **Quantum Lattice Model (QLM)** is a deterministic phase–action framework in which fundamental physics emerges from discrete Planck-scale lattice dynamics.  
In QLM, spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional lattice where each lattice tick advances physical phase by exactly one radian and transports one quantum of reduced action, ℏ.

From this single primitive rule, the full system of Planck units, gravitational coupling, and related physical structure follows in closed algebraic form.

## Core Principles

QLM is built on the following foundational assumptions:

- **Discrete Planck lattice**  
  Spacetime consists of fundamental spatial and temporal increments (ℓₚ, tₚ).

- **Per-radian action transport**  
  Each lattice tick advances phase by one radian and carries exactly ℏ of action.

- **Deterministic dynamics**  
  Physical evolution is deterministic phase–action propagation; probabilistic behavior is emergent.

- **ħ-based Planck units**  
  All Planck quantities are derived using reduced action per radian, not dimensional square-root combinations of {G, ħ, c}.

These rules define a minimal and internally consistent foundation from which mechanical, electromagnetic, geometric, and thermodynamic quantities arise.

## Canonical Foundations

The canonical foundations of QLM are defined in the following work:

**Quantum Lattice Model: Reduced-Action Foundations & Planck-Unit Derivations**  
(December 4, 2025)

This paper establishes:
- the per-radian Planck energy \( Eₚ = \hbar / tₚ \),
- the collapse of conventional Planck-unit square roots to minimal ħ-based forms,
- gravitational coupling expressed as lattice impedance,
- electromagnetic structure and hydrogenic calibration,
- exact algebraic closure across physical sectors.

### Notation Alignment Notice

A notation-aligned archival version of the foundations paper was uploaded on December 26, 2025 under the same project to disambiguate Planck **volume** notation from electromagnetic voltage.  
The update modifies notation only; no equations, derivations, assumptions, or results were changed.  
The December 4, 2025 paper remains the canonical foundations reference.

## Extensions and Derived Results

QLM supports nontrivial extensions without modification of its foundational rules.

### Planck Energy Density Cap and Saturated Core Completion

This extension demonstrates that QLM implies:
- a universal Planck energy density cap,
- a maximum lattice mass density,
- a minimal, non-singular saturated-core interior for gravitational collapse,
- exact Schwarzschild exterior behavior with no exotic matter or free parameters.

All results are derived strictly from the canonical foundations, serving as a validation of the framework’s internal consistency.

## Notation and Symbol Registry

QLM treats notation as part of the formal structure of the theory.

A dedicated notation registry is maintained to:
- prevent symbol collisions,
- preserve consistency across papers and extensions,
- ensure long-term clarity as the framework expands.

Readers and contributors should consult the notation registry before introducing new symbols.

## Tools

This repository includes **Titus**, an interactive system designed to explore, verify, and apply Quantum Lattice Model (QLM) derivations and constraints.

Titus is a **companion tool**:
- it does not define QLM,
- it does not modify the framework,
- it operates strictly from the canonical foundations and extensions.

QLM remains the sole source of physical definitions and assumptions.

## Status and Scope

QLM is an actively developed theoretical framework.

- Foundations are stable.
- Extensions are derived strictly from established primitives.
- Speculative or exploratory ideas are kept separate from canonical results.

This repository serves as the **authoritative reference** for the Quantum Lattice Model.
