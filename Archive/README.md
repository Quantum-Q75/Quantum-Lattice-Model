# QLM Archive

This directory documents **external archival records** of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

Archival links preserve historical uploads, timestamps, and registrations. They serve as immutable records of publication history and provenance but do not define the canonical form of the framework.

The GitHub repository is the canonical reference for current QLM documents.

## Role of Archives

Archives provide:
- permanent timestamped records,
- citation traceability,
- and historical transparency.

They do not supersede or modify the canonical QLM documents maintained in this repository.
