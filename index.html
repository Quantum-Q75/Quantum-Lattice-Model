  <h1>Quantum Lattice Model (QLM)</h1>

  <p>
    The <strong>Quantum Lattice Model (QLM)</strong> is a deterministic phase–action
    framework in which fundamental physics emerges from discrete Planck-scale lattice
    dynamics.
  </p>

  <p>
    In QLM, spacetime is modeled as a four-dimensional lattice where each lattice tick
    advances physical phase by exactly one radian and transports one quantum of reduced
    action, ℏ.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this single primitive rule, the full system of Planck units, gravitational
    coupling, and related physical structure follows in closed algebraic form.

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Discrete Planck lattice:</strong> spacetime consists of fundamental spatial and temporal increments (ℓₚ, tₚ).</li>
    <li><strong>Per-radian action transport:</strong> each lattice tick advances phase by one radian and carries exactly ℏ of action.</li>
    <li><strong>Deterministic dynamics:</strong> physical evolution is deterministic phase–action propagation; probabilistic behavior is emergent.</li>
    <li><strong>ħ-based Planck units:</strong> all Planck quantities are derived using reduced action per radian, not dimensional square-root combinations of {G, ħ, c}.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Canonical Foundations</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Quantum Lattice Model: Reduced-Action Foundations &amp; Planck-Unit Derivations</strong><br>
    December 4, 2025
  </p>

  <p>
    A notation-aligned archival version uploaded on December 26, 2025 modifies notation
    only and does not change any equations, derivations, assumptions, or results.
    The December 4, 2025 paper remains the canonical foundations reference.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Extensions</h2>

  <p>
    QLM supports nontrivial extensions without modification of its foundational rules.
    The Planck energy density cap and saturated-core completion derive directly from the
    canonical foundations and preserve exact Schwarzschild exterior behavior.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Notation Registry</h2>

  <p>
    Notation is treated as part of the formal structure of QLM. Until the consolidated
    registry document is present, the canonical papers remain the authoritative source
    of symbol definitions.

  <h2>Tools — Titus</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Titus</strong> is an interactive companion system designed to explore,
    explain, and verify the Quantum Lattice Model using its canonical foundations and
    extensions.

  <h2>Status and Scope</h2>

  <p>
    QLM is an actively developed theoretical framework. Foundations are stable.
    Extensions are derived strictly from established primitives.
