  <h1>QLM Notation Registry</h1>

  <p>
    This directory contains the <strong>formal notation registry</strong> of the
    Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).
  </p>

  <p>
    QLM treats notation as part of the model’s formal structure. Symbols are defined
    to avoid ambiguity, prevent collisions between physical quantities, and maintain
    consistency across foundational and extended results.
  </p>

  <h2>Scope</h2>

  <p>
    The notation registry defines:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>the canonical symbols used in QLM,</li>
    <li>their physical meaning and dimensional role,</li>
    <li>and the rules governing symbol usage across the framework.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Notation changes documented here are restricted to
    <strong>symbolic clarity only</strong> and do not modify physical assumptions,
    equations, or results.
  </p>

  <h2>Current Authority</h2>

  <p>
    At present, canonical notation is defined within the QLM foundations and extension
    papers contained in this repository. Symbol usage across these works is internally
    consistent.
  </p>

  <p>
    This directory serves as the designated location for the consolidated notation
    registry and will host the authoritative notation document when finalized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until that document is present, the canonical papers remain the controlling
    reference for symbol definitions.
