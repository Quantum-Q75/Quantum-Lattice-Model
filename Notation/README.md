# QLM Notation Registry

This directory contains the **formal notation registry** of the Quantum Lattice Model (QLM).

QLM treats notation as part of the model’s formal structure. Symbols are defined to avoid ambiguity, prevent collisions between physical quantities, and maintain consistency across foundational and extended results.

## Scope

The notation registry defines:
- the canonical symbols used in QLM,
- their physical meaning and dimensional role,
- and the rules governing symbol usage across the framework.

Notation changes documented here are restricted to **symbolic clarity only** and do not modify physical assumptions, equations, or results.

## Current Authority

At present, canonical notation is defined within the QLM foundations and extension papers contained in this repository. Symbol usage across these works is internally consistent.

This directory serves as the designated location for the consolidated notation registry and will host the authoritative notation document when finalized.

Until that document is present, the canonical papers remain the controlling reference for symbol definitions.
